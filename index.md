Hi, I am Rahul Singh Maharjan and I am Ph.D. student at the [Centre for Robotics and AI][Centre for Robotics and AI] at [University of Manchester, United Kingdom][University of Manchester, United Kingdom]. Previously, I graduated with a Master's of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea][Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea] at [Computer Vision Lab][Computer Vision Lab].  Prior to joining Sungkyunkwan, I received my Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Pokhara University, Nepal][Pokhara University, Nepal].
<br/>


I am broadly interested in different forms of artificial intelligence that carry out the assigned tasks robustly and reliably. In an **unsorted manner**, I spend most of weekdays and some weekends on:

* Continual Learning
* Uncertainty Driven Deep Learning
* Human-Robot Interaction
* Affective Computing

Apart from above, I frequently autodidactic myself on different topics such as **Stoic**,  **social choice theory** and more.

<br/>
Stay Tuned. More updates are coming pretty soon. :)
